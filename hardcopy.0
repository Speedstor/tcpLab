Carbon Fixation
- Autotrophs absorb carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, lipids and all the other carbon compounds (C02 - 390 umol/mol and varies)
- Carbon dioxide with H2O can form cabronic acid(H2CO3) as CO2 is soluble in water -> then can dissociate to form hydrogen and hydrogen car
bonate ions
        - carbonic acid reduced the pH of water, CO2 and H2CO3 are both used by plants to make carbohydrates and other carbon compounds
- Autotrophs keep their concentration of CO2 low by fixing them into carbon compounds -> concentration gradient [stomata - diffusion | enti
re leave is permeable to CO2]

Methanogenesis (CH4)
- Methane is produced widely in anaerobic environments in anaerobic conditions by methanogenic archaeans
- 3 step process:       1. bacteria convert organic matter into mixture of organic acids, alcohol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide
                        2. other bacteria use organic acdis and alcohol to produce acetate, CO2 and H
                        3. Arcaheans produce methane from CO2, H, acetate (only archaen is methaogenic)
        - Chemical reactions: CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H20
                              CH3COOH -> CH4 + CO2
- environment in: mud in shores and bed of lakes, swamps, wetlands, guts of terminites, landfills sites where organic matter is abundance
- methane persist in atmosphere for avg of 12 yeasrs and get naturally oxidized in the stratosphere with monatmoic oxygen and highly reacti
ve hydroxyl radicals

Peat formation:
- water is unable to drain out of soil and become waterlogged and anaerobic, air pockets are not avaliable for saprotrophs -> dead organic
matter is not fully decomposed
        - large quantities of partially decomposed organic matter have accumulated in ecosystems and are composed into dark brown acidic am
terial called peat (3% of Earth surface)

Fossilized organic matter
- chemically stable carbon and carbon compounds can remain unchanged in rocks for long time, and incomplete decomposition of carbon and bur
ial of sediments result in deposits of carbon
- coal is formed when deposis of peat are buried under other sediments (compressed, heated) [large amount from Pennsylvanian sub-period of
coastal swamps]
- oil and natural gas are formed in the mud and other sediments at the bottom of seas and lakes where condition are anaerobic and decomposi
tion is incomplete
        - chemical changes occure to produce complex mixtures of liquid carbon compounds or gases -> crude oil and natural gas [methane] (p
orous rocks are used to prevent deposit's escape
- combustion is the oxxidation reactions when organic matter is heated to its ignition temperature with the presense of oxygen [different a
reas have diff normal fires for combustion
        - calcium carbonate dissolves away in acide conditions or get percipitated, but in neutral or alkaline conditions, it is stable and
 deposit to hard animal parts

Elements in the Environment
- a pool is a reserve of the element, where it resides in the ecosystem; flux is the transfer of the element from one pool to another
- CO2 and CHO3 affect photosysthesis rates and pH of seawater, and it inlfuences global temperatures (heat) -> weather


Greenhouse gases
- greenhouse effect are the result effect of gases that retains heat within the air by absorbing long-wave radiation
        - CO2 from combustion of biomass -> photosynthesis and dissolve into water
        - water vaporation from evaporation and transpiration
        - methane from marshes and waterlogged habitats
        - nitrous oxide released naturally by bacteria, agriculture and vehicle exhausts
- Earth's atmosphere have less than 1% of greenhouse gases, and is filled with oxygen and nitrogen instead
- UV and visible wv being short and Infrared wv being long (** the concentration of these gases plays a huge role)                        !
!TODO: which one affects greenhouse effect
        - short wavelengths radiation have 25-30% absorbed through the atmosphere, while 70-75% reaches Earth's surface
